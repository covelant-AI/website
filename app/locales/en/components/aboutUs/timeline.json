      "paragraph": "Covelant started with a simple question from founders Omar Badawy and Nicolo Forti: “What would happen if AI watched a sports match?” Could it understand what’s going on and, if it can, could it even predict who might win before the match begins? That spark turned into experiments that turned into something they didn't imagine."

      "paragraph": "For a long stretch we worked, failed, learned, and iterated, often in frustration and uncertainty. We tried models, datasets, and architectures, and we assembled a team of engineers, designers, and go-to-market leaders who shared the vision. Eventually, we broke through. Since then, we’ve earned a podium finish at the 2025 MIT AI Global Hackathon, refined the product with hands-on feedback from coaches and athletes, and begun conversations with leading federations."

      "paragraph": "After officially launching Sideline in July of 2025, we are now focused on refining the product, expanding to new sports, and scaling our impact. With new monitoring tools, enhanced AI capabilities, and a growing team, we are excited for what lies ahead. We have been accepted to the ALPHA program at Websummit in addition to rolling out new features and partnerships that we are excited to talk about soon.
